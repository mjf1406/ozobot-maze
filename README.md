# Ozobot Maze Generator

## To-do List

### p2

- Generation
  - Eller's algo
  - Recursive Backtracking
  - Prim's algo
  - Kruskal's algo
- Inputs
  - Number of commands required to finish the maze
    - Minimum: ???
    - Maximum: ???
  - Difficulty
    - proxy for how long the black line is that bit follows
    - determines which command codes are required to finish the maze
  - Generate two? (Front and back of page)
  - Generate larger mazes? (tape multiple pages together)
  - Grid type
    - square
    - circle
    - hex
- Output
  - How wide is the Bit black line?
  - Option to reveal the required commands with or without the quantities

### p1

- algo: Ozobot constraints implemented
  - [ ] at least 25mm between any parallel tracks
  - [ ] Zigzag and Backwalk require at least 64mm after to pick up another color code
  - [ ] Line Switch Left/Right require a parallel line next to tit
  - [ ] Line Switch Straight requires a perpendicular line
  - [ ] At least 51mm between color codes
  - [ ] there must be at least 25mm from a corner/intersection before another corner/intersection/color code
  - [ ] line that end in a color must have a safe area with a diameter of 20mm starting from the end of the line
  - [ ] color codes are 5mm x 5mm
  - [ ] line thickness
    - min: 4.5mm
    - max: 6mm
  - [ ] each side of a line must have at least 12mm of white space
  - [ ] curves must have a minimum diameter of 25mm
  - [ ] corner minimum angel is 90deg
  - [ ] add a calibration circle to each maze: 39mm diameter

### p0

- UI: the reveal hints items now display in the output when checked
- UX: updating the page size or difficulty no longer rerenders the output and user is alerted that they will have to generate a new maze if they want to see the changes take effect
- UI: added an X button to the title input to clear it
